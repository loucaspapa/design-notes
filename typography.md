## 1.1 Introduction to typography
“Perfect typography is more science than an art” is a famous quote attributed to Jan Tschichold—the man that published his revolutionary book The New Typography in 1927. He, among other typographers from that era, had a profound impact in the field of typography. >?

“Typography is more art than engineering—though engineering is certainly a part of it” is what Robert Bringhurst, author of The Elements of Typographic Style (recognised as the typography bible), believes in. 

It might seem strange at first, that such influential men in typography could have such contradicting opinions when it comes to defining it. Tschichold believed it was more science, Bringhurst sees it more as an art. Both placed it on the line connecting the two but they placed it on the opposite ends.

![Figure 1: Different definitions of typography.](figure-11.png)

Tschichold was a part of the revolution in graphic design in the early 1920s. It was the time of industrialization. A time when the engineer was seen as the savior of the world. Engineering was in front and center of whatever was produced. Type setting as a process was being swept into this new industrialized world. Whatever tools graphic designers used at that time, they needed engineering skills. This probably shaped Tschichold’s opinion when it came to defining typography.

Bringhurst already witnessed the magic of digital design. There’s no more physical parts that need to be assembled in the type setting process. The age of information made that process a matter of seconds instead of hours. Designers only need the right software and a right printer these days. Both are tools they don’t produce themselves. So there’s very little, or no engineering in a modern print design process. Bringhurst focused on the print typography in his book which is what may sway his definition of typography more on the side of art.

### Web developers should have typography skills too
![Figure 2: Web typography, along with interaction design, UX design, web animation etc. all belong into the gray area between design and front-end development.](figure-12.jpg)

I believe that when it comes to the web, typography lies right in the middle. That’s why I think both designers and developers need to learn the basics of typography. It is expected from designers to have these skills. It’s expected that they know how to type set and when to choose what typeface. How to shape a paragraph and how to use a scale. How to use grids to establish rhythm in their work. I’ve worked with many designers so far and found that’s rarely the case. Either the designers are self-taught and haven’t learned about the importance of typography yet or they studied graphic design and saw it just as a class they had to attend. Developers, don’t expect your designers to be proficient in typography. 

Whatever gets designed for the web needs to be transformed into code. There is no printer. No magic button that transforms designs into code. Not in a way that could actually get used. People that can do both parts well, design and code, are rare. It takes a lot of time and dedication to really master both sets of skills. This means that even the designers who have good typography skills usually don’t have the skills to transform their work into what really counts—code. So it falls on web developers to cover a large part of this grey area. Web developers who aren’t expected to have any of those skills. Web developers that try their best to transform those designs into code, but fail to see small details that make a difference. It’s time we recognize the importance of their role in shaping web typography. It’s time we stop excluding them from the design process. The design process isn’t something designers should own themselves, it’s something where other people can take part and make their own contributions. Don’t simply follow what is drawn by a designer—an approximation of what the website should look like. Understand why it’s done so. Correct your designer when it doesn’t make sense. Work on web typography. Work on typographic details with your designer. Work together. It’s your job to produce a typographic style that works—as a team.

That’s where Better Web Type comes in. And that’s why it’s designed for both web designers and web developers. Its goal is to put web typography right in the middle between art (design) and engineering (development). To cover most of that grey area and invite web developers in the design process. To educate the people that are involved (or the ones that should be) in a web design process to do a better job when it comes to web typography. To start producing a better web typography in order to be able to contribute to a better web. A web that is readable. A web that doesn’t scream at the reader. A web that informs.

### Why is typography important
Jan Tschichold and Robert Bringhurst may not agree on how to define typography, but they certainly agreed on what its goal is. They just used different words to describe it. “The essence of new typography is clarity” is set in bold in Jan Tschichold’s book. “The new typography is distinguished from the old by the fact that its first objective is to develop its visible form out of the functions of the text… form must be created out of function” Tschichold elaborates. 

Bringhurst was more concrete. Typography must invite the reader into text, reveal the tenor and meaning of the text, clarify its structure and order and link the text with other existing elements. 

> Most people think typography is about fonts. Most designers think typography is about fonts.
> Typography is more than that, it’s expressing language through type. Placement, composition, type choice.

—Mark Boulton

Typography is not about fonts alone. It’s not about type size, margins, spacing, scales or colour. Typography is about organizing information in an objective way. It’s about information and how we transfer this information to the reader. Size, colours and fonts are just tools that help us put this information into the right shape. And as we will see, all these tools must work together as a whole. None is independent of the others. Web designers and web developers alike need to take a step back from merely choosing fonts and take a look at the bigger picture that typography actually is.

### Font or typeface?
Let’s clarify this before we continue. Using the word “font” in a company of typographers will earn you a few odd looks. Some of them might even get on the offensive and won’t hesitate to call you a newbie or even an ignorant. “Font” is for a typeface like “mp3” is for a song. And I have never heard anyone say “I really like that mp3”!

I tend to use both words. It simply depends on who I talk to. “Typeface” might be unclear to people who aren’t into typography so I’ll use “font” in that case. But in this course I’ll use the words according to their actual meaning. A “font” will mean “helvetica.ttf” and a typeface will mean “Helvetica” (a family of different weights and styles).

## 1.2 Equilateral triangle of a perfect paragraph

> The reader should be able to read the message of a text easily and comfortably. This depends to a not inconsiderable extent on the size > of the type, the length of the lines and the leading (line-height).

—Josef Mueller-Brockmann

We don’t read letter per letter. We only do that when we’re children and are still learning to read. After that we read word by word. The words that we’ve become familiar with are stored in our brains. So reading is basically recognising shapes of words. Our eyes constantly move left and right in the process of reading. They do that so quickly that we don’t even notice. These eye movements are called saccades. They’re broken up by fixations which usually come at the end of words. After each line of text our eyes get a longer break as we switch focus to the next line in the text. Make these lines too long and the eyes will get tired quicker. Make the spacing between the lines too tight and our eyes will get confused on which line to start reading.

Typography can improve a text’s readability by following the basic general principles that have been developed since the first printing machine back in the 15th century. These general principles are adapted to the way we read.

A well designed and type set text is easier to read because it takes these considerations into account. This is why type size (and colour), measure (line width) and leading (line-height) are so important. With these we literally shape the reading experience. There’s typographers that do this for books and graphic designers that do it for magazines and other printed media. On the web, this task falls somewhere between the web designer and web developer. In rare cases, this would be the same person.


### Type size & colour
One of the mistakes that most web sites make is that they make the main body text too small. Back in early 2000s it was common practice to set the body text to a size of around 11px. But back then the screens were smaller with lower screen resolutions. 11px back then was larger than it is now.

A common rule for setting the body text is to set it to a size that would match the size of the text in a book at an arm’s length distance.
 
Recommended size for today’s screens is 16px for mobile and from 18 to 22 px for desktop. This also depends on the typeface. As we’ll see later in the course, some typefaces set at 16px may seem larger than others.

“Type colour” in typography doesn’t mean actual colour like red, blue or green. Type colour means how heavy black type on a light background looks like. A typeface of the same size and same weight may seem heavier than another one.  

### Line width (measure)

Reading very long lines of text is tiring for our eyes. Our eyes need constant pauses which are provided by line breaks. In that instance of switching to the next line, our eyes get that short pause. Short, but long enough to keep them going for longer. It’s like an engine that doesn’t run on full all the time so it keeps going longer without overheating.

The ideal width of a line of text is from 45 to 75 characters—including spaces. Anything that reaches far from that range gets hard to read very quickly. Too much line switching when lines are too short and to few breaks for the eyes when they’re too long.
 
### Line-height (leading)

Line-height, or leading as it’s usually referred to in print, is the main pillar of rhythm in typography. We’ll cover that later in the course, in the lesson 6—Rhythm in web typography. For now, let’s take a look at what affects the line-height.
 
Too many designers or web developers that I’ve met think of line-height as an isolated text feature. So they tend to set it based on what seems right. Consequently, line-height is something that gets set without too much consideration. But line-height is too important to be set so mindlessly. The width of the lines affects the line-height. The longer the lines, the more space between them is required. Type size affects the line-height. The larger the type, the larger the line-height should be as well. Type colour affects it too. Darker and heavier type requires more space between the lines. And in the end, the typeface itself may affect it as well. We’ll cover these later in the course but I already mentioned that some typeface may seem larger than others. Some, mostly serifed typefaces, will seem heavier. Those will require more space between the lines too.

Now that you know that line-height is very important and that it should never be considered as an isolated feature, let’s look at general best practices. For paragraphs, ideal line-height is usually between 1,3 and 1,6. So a body text set at 16px should have a line-height from 21 to 26 px. This will depend on the things mentioned earlier: typeface design, type size, weight etc.

Headings are usually much shorter so they need to have less space between the lines so they don’t look like they’re drifting apart. Recommended line-height for headings is from 1 to 1,2 so a heading set at 24 px will need a line-height from 24 to 29 px. This may seem a bit ridiculous at first but try it. Once you see the difference you can’t unsee it.
 
Note that in languages that use capital letters more than others (German for example), it’s recommended to use a larger line-height.

### The equilateral triangle
There are some general best practices in typography but they’re never definite. As we saw with the line-height, we’re commonly presented with ranges that we should use. What to choose from that range takes time to learn. The eye needs time to get sharper in noticing these differences. That’s why it may seem wrong at first when you set your heading to a smaller line-height than the paragraphs, but in time you’ll see that it’s actually correct.
 
And so we come to what I call the Equilateral triangle of a perfect paragraph. We’ve looked at type size, measure and line-height in isolation (as much as we could). By doing so, we already learned that these features are interconnected. They can’t be considered in isolation and they never should be. That’s why an equilateral triangle is a perfect representation of a well designed paragraph of text. For it, we need a good type size that matches the measure, which matches the line height. Get one of them wrong and your triangle will get skewed.

Unfortunately I can’t give you definite numbers of a perfect paragraph as there are millions of combinations out there. But I can give you a few examples that will help you train your eye. Try to pay attention to the details and compare the type size, the lengths of the lines and the spacing between them.

## 1.3 Anatomy of a typeface

Typefaces come in all shapes and forms. Serif and sans-serif are the two main groups but each consists of numerous styles. Old style, transitional, neoclassical, slab, clarendon and glyphic for serifed typefaces; grotesque, square, humanistic and geometric for the sans serifs. Exploring these reminds me of space exploration. A vast amount of typefaces, each different from the other, each unique, each special. Just like stars and planets, despite their uniqueness, all typefaces have something in common—their anatomy. No matter how special or unique their style is, all typefaces share most of their main features. Looking at typefaces is just like gazing at the night sky and looking at the stars. Nothing special if you don’t know what you’re looking at but very interesting if you know where to look and recognizing unique features that define the typefaces (or stars).

Let’s look at a few main features that will help you gaze the sky a bit better. We don’t need to know all the details so we’ll cover the most basic features. Ascenders and descenders are the most noticeable. They define the shapes of letters and they define the letters themselves. Ascenders are the parts of letters that lie beyond the x-height line and the descenders are the parts that lie below the baseline. Cap height marks the most upper part of the capital letters. Notice that the ascenders go beyond that line. Also notice how some letters go slightly beyond the baseline and the x-height line. Take a look at the “o” and “e” in the figure x. Type designers do that to make the letters optically balanced. A more rounded letter needs to be a bit larger to seem balanced with the other larger and less round letters.

### Type colour & weight
I mentioned type colour in the previous lesson already. If you remember, I wrote that in typography  by type colour we don’t mean actual colour. We mean how heavy a black typeface looks like on a white background. Let’s do a quick test. We have two typefaces: Merriweather and Georgia. Both are beautiful serifed typefaces. Let’s set them to a size of 16px, apply a dark grey colour and put them on a white background. Let’s put them side by side so we can compare them easily.

Spend a few moments observing the typefaces and the features we just went through. If you spend enough time doing this, you’ll notice the main difference between the two. Merriweather looks heavier. It looks darker. It even looks larger—we’ll come to that soon, let’s focus on the colour and weight for now. Now let’s take a step backwards and look at longer paragraphs. Both are set in regular weight, at the same size and with the same line-height. Yet, they look very different. Georgia has a higher contrast than Merriweather which makes it look lighter. This, combined with other features (height and size of letters) give Georgia less presence on the page. That’s what we mean when we say “type colour” in typography.

### X-height
We noticed the difference in size of type in the last example. Even though both paragraphs are set at the same size (18px), the two typefaces look very different. Let’s take a closer look.

Let’s compare the attributes of both typefaces. Spend a few minutes observing and comparing them. Done? Ok, let’s see. Let’s draw the lines: the baseline, the x-height line, the cap-height line and the line where descenders end. Let’s do that for Merriweather only as it will be easier to spot the differences.

The baseline lies right at the bottom edge of the lowercase x and the x-height line right at the top edge of it, hence the name x-height. I drew the lines long enough so they go all the way to the side where the word set in Georgia lies. Have you noticed the difference yet? The letters of the same word, set at the same size but set in Georgia don’t touch the x-height line coming from the same word set in Merriweather. The x-height of Georgia is therefore shorter than the one of Merriweather. Take a look at the cap-height line and you’ll notice the same. The height of letters in Georgia, both upper and lowercase, are shorter than the same letters in Merriweather. That’s what makes Merriweather seem taller than Georgia.

We set type sizes on the web by specific dimensions. Whether in pixels, EMs or REMs—we always end up with type set in particular size set in pixels. But these pixels don’t mean a lot in typography. It all depends on the x-height of a typeface.

Typefaces with a taller x-height are considered modern and easier to read. Merriweather, Roboto Slab and Freight Text are great examples of modern serifed typefaces with a large x-height.

Typefaces with a smaller x-height are considered less modern and classical. Great examples include typefaces like Garamond, Baskerville and Bodoni.

We’ll come back to x-height in the lesson about combining typefaces so keep it in mind.
