# Le Wagon Sketch Workshop 22/08/16

## 1. Introduction
Hello, I'm [Loucas Papantoniou][http://loucaspapa.org/], designer at [Central](http://central.team/). 
In this workshop we'll be using Sketch as our primary design tool. Bohemian Coding Sketch is a very powerful, yet surprisingly lighweight program. 

Sketch is a vector drawing app intended for designers of all sorts. Vector-based drawing is by far the the best way to design websites, icons or interfaces. Sketch is not a bitmap editor. This means that if you want to do photo correction or draw with brushes, this is not the app for you.

This being a tutorial means we can't cover everything. Our goal is to get you creating as fast as possible.

## 2. Sketch Interface
* the toolbar on the top contains all the tools you need to create your masterpiece. The first set of tools in the default toolbar are for adding new layers; shapes, images, symbols and more.

* the inspector on the right lets you adjust the properties of the selected layer such as: position, size, opacity, bleding, corner radius for a rectangle or the number of points for a polygon. You can also perform math operations: add, subtract, divide, multiply.  In the radius input field you can specify a different value for each corner by using "/" (ex. 40.0/40/0).

From the inspector you can also set the style attributes of your layer such as the border, fill, shadows, and blur attributes

* the layer list on your left contains all the layers and Artboards in your document. You can see which layer is locked, invisible, has a mask, or is marked for export. Here you can reorder layers and choose Boolean Operations for subpaths of a shape. You can also group layers or rename them to keep your document organised.

* your working canvas is on the middle. It's infinite in size; you can scroll as far as you want in any direction, so you have complete freedom on how you set up your drawing area.

### 3.1 Layers
Layers are the basic building blocks of content in Sketch.
How to add, select, move, resize, rotate and edit layers. 

### 3.2 Shapes
The most common type of layers in your document will be shapes.
There is a large variety of default shapes provided with Sketch such as circles, rectangles, stars and more. Some of these shapes have extra options, such as (rounded) rectangles and the star shape.

You can:
* edit a shape
* create a unique shape from basic shapes by using boolean operations
	* Union: The result of a union operation is a vector that is the sum of both vectors’ areas.
	* Subtract: The result of a subtract operation is a vector where the area of the top shape is removed from the one under it.
	* Intersect: The result of a intersect operation is a vector consisting of the parts where the original shapes overlapped.
	* Difference: The result of a difference operation is a vector that is exactly the part where they didn’t overlap. it’s the inverse of an intersect operation
* rotate and transform a shape to skew a layer symmetrically.
* use a mask to constrain or crop one layer into another.
* use scissors: to cut away lines from an existing vector shape. 
* rotate copies
* use pencil

### 3.3 Text
Text inspector, Shared styles, Text on Path, Convert to outlines

### 3.4 Images

### 3.5 Symbols
Symbols is a powerful feature in Sketch that allows you to reuse elements easily across Artboards and Pages.

### 3.6 Styling
Fills
Borders
Shadows
Blur
Color
Gradients
Shared Styles

* vector tool: "V", shift for 45,90 degree angle, "ESC", scissor tool, curved vector lines, editing lines
* bezier curves: draw reload icon, explain straight, mirrored, disconnected, asymmetric
* borders
* fills
* union, subtract, intersect and difference
* symbols: create a symbol, iOS UI
* make grid

* flip tool
* sketch mirror
* exporting
* adding fonts

## 4. Exercises
For this workshop we'll use the sketch file you'll find [in this shared dropbox folder](https://www.dropbox.com/sh/e5j5k77zo268fni/AABzqrpuVz9M4XTj2H60_S_6a?dl=0). 

### 4.1 Weather icon
We're going to work on this weather icon. It might look complicated, but if you double click on it you'll see it consists of circles and rectangles that create this form. 

### 4.2 Floating sphere
One more quick exercise to learn how to use gradients when we need to. 

### 4.3 Bezier Curves
We're going to trace the reload icon to learn how to use the vector tool. 

### 4.4 The NYT cooking app
We'll use [the screenshots from NYT cooking app](http://pttrns.com/applications/408) and will try to replicate them to start learning how to use Sketch.
